# Big Data & Business Analytics
This master course consisted in 10 h/week of in-person classes, and more than 20 modules that took between 1 and 6 weeks. Not all these modules have asked for a final essay about its subject, but most of them did, so here I have decided to present all of them. Modules that won't be shown:

1. Introduction - Business Intelligence
2. Python
3. DataScience workflow
4. Text Mining
5. Open Data
6. Distributed Computation - Spark
7. DevOps

## SQL Databases:

* Entity - relationship diagram, from scratch.
* Run an SQL Server on your machine.
* Create your own SQL database.
* From `SELECT *` to User Defined Functions.
* Normalization and normal forms.

During this module I was still using Latex to make my documents, and compiling them to `pdf`.
